## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No options showing"
**Solution**: Make sure your deck has at least 4 cards. Quiz Mode needs multiple cards to generate options.

### Problem: "Quiz seems too easy/hard"
**Solution**: This is normal! Try focusing on the cards you get wrong and review them in Study Mode.

### Problem: "Can't click options"
**Solution**: Wait for the question to fully load. Sometimes there's a brief delay after selecting an answer.

### Problem: "Score not incrementing correctly"
**Solution**: Skipped questions don't count. Only answered questions add to your score.
